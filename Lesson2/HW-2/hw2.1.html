<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by Scottish novelist and playwright J. M. Barrie. A free-spirited and
    mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood having adventures
    on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates, mermaids,
    Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.

    Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works
    by Barrie, The Little White Bird (1902, with chapters 13â€“18 published in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in 1906),
    and the West End stage play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel
    Peter and Wendy), the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding
    on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.

<p>Barrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by the sculptor George Frampton, which was erected overnight in Kensington
    Gardens on 30 April 1912 as a surprise to the children of London.[1] Six other statues have been cast from the
    original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued
    by the Royal Mail on the centenary of Barrie's creation of the character.[2]</p>
